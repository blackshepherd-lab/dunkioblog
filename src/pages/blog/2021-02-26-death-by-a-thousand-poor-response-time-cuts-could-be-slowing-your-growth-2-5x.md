  We know intuitively that response times for sales requests need to be fast.


  We know it because if we walked into a shop, selected the item we wanted to buy and took it to the counter to pay, and did not find a salesperson, we would probably wait a total of 2 minutes before we walked out of the shop.


  Somehow software companies think the rules don't apply to them, and they can keep customers waiting 24 hours or more, and sometimes up to a week.

We know intuitively that response times for sales requests need to be fast.

We know it because if we walked into a shop, selected the item we wanted to buy and took it to the counter to pay, and did not find a salesperson, we would probably wait a total of 2 minutes before we walked out of the shop.

Somehow software companies think the rules don't apply to them, and they can keep customers waiting 24 hours or more, and sometimes up to a week.

An article from the *Harvard Business Review* called: ***[The Short Life of Online Sales Leads](https://hbr.org/2011/03/the-short-life-of-online-sales-leads)*** expands on this further:

> Our research shows that most companies are not responding nearly fast enough... We audited 2,241 U.S. companies, measuring how long each took to respond to a web-generated test lead. 
>
> Although 37% responded to their lead within an hour, and 16% responded within one to 24 hours, 24% took more than 24 hours—and 23% of the companies never responded at all. The average response time, among companies that responded within 30 days, was 42 hours.
>
> **Firms that tried to contact potential customers within an hour of receiving a query were nearly seven times as likely to qualify the lead** (which we defined as having a meaningful conversation with a key decision maker) as those that tried to contact the customer even an hour later—**and more than 60 times as likely as companies that waited 24 hours or longer.**

This work builds on [a body of research done on web leads ](http://www.leadresponsemanagement.org/lrm_study)by Dr James Oldroyd of Kellogg University, [reported on Forbes website: ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenkrogue/2012/07/12/the-black-hole-that-executives-dont-know-about/#73be5f0438e3)

> This information was all very interesting, but Dr. Oldroyd was far more excited to share what he found next (taken from the original Executive Summary):
>
> “The odds of calling to contact a lead decrease by over **10 times** in the 1st hour.
>
> The odds of calling to **qualify** a lead decrease by over **6 times** in the 1st hour.
>
> After **20 hours** every additional dial your salespeople make actually hurts your ability to make contact to qualify a lead.”
>
> “The odds of *contacting* a lead if called in 5 minutes are **100 times higher** versus 30 minutes.
>
> The odds of *qualifying* a lead if called in 5 minutes are **21 times higher** versus 30 minutes.”

> “How significant is a **100x** increase in contact ratios on the value of leads? How much effect does a **21x** increase in qualification have on the overall sales revenue of a company?”

### Why is response time so important?

1. **It is the moment of peak customer interest** (they already want it, you don't really have to sell it)
2. **You wow your customer** with your operational excellence and attention to service (increases inclination to purchase)
3. **They are present** (you have a conversation and can sell to them, whereas they will be busy if you schedule it for later)
4. **If you don't respond, someone else will** - nobody is sitting around waiting for you, especially if your competition is half decent.
