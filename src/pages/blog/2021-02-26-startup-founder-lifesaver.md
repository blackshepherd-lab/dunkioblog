Are you a startup founder? 

You would know that ruthless prioritisation is the way to get anything done.

**This means you take the list of 100 things that you could be working on at any given time, and throw out 97 of them.**

You can almost always boil your priorities down to 3 things that you should be doing at any given time.

**Where does this not work?**

You have probably heard it before, and bookmarked it as something you would do later. Perhaps after finishing the 100 tasks on your list.

**The reason many founders can't implement this advice effectively is the are not able to hire people to take on some of the key tasks in their business.**

This is a sort of mental trap.

*I can't hire someone, because I can't afford it.*

*I can't afford it, because I haven't got enough revenue.* 

*I haven't got enough revenue because I can't do all the tasks needed to raise revenue, just not enough time.*

*I need to hire someone to help do some of the stuff.*

*I don't know who to hire -—>* go back to start of the loop.

**We can get you out of the trap**
