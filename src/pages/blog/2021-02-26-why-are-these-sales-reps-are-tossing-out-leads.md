You have spent countless hours and thousands of dollars launching a digital product or SaaS.

You hired a sales team to qualify and sell to your inbound leads.

You paid for traffic - either in valuable time, or in online ads. Either way, you paid for it.

Visitors come onto your site looking for pricing and product information, they find the information on the product too sparse to understand so they hit that shiny "Request Demo" button.

A few days later your sales rep calls them.

Listen to some recordings of what happens on these calls. 

It is a race to disqualify the lead as soon as possible. 

Even the most keen buyers of your product will have a bad taste in their mouth after these calls. They ask themselves: is this a police interrogation? Do I have to prove myself to you in order to buy your product?

> Sales Rep: "How big is your company"
>
> Sales Rep:"Where are your offices?"
>
> Sales Rep:"What is your role?"
>
> Sales Rep:"What is your budget"

> Sales Rep:"How big is your company?" - wait, didn't I just answer that???

How about providing some information about the product, and telling them the price. Is it that hard?

It is almost as if the incentive structure for your sales team, and the processes they have inherited has set them up to seek to disqualify a customer as soon as possible.

And by the way, if you have a highly motivated buyer, and you make them wait 3 days to talk to a sales person, only for them to find that it is nothing but a glorified meeting setter - you have successfully managed to disqualify your lead (well done!).

Yes that may seem like the intelligent solution when you have limited time and have to focus on the most valuable leads, but we at 30SS take a different approach.

We take the leads that you have, ALL of them, and **work to actively make them customers.**

We get paid on commission only - so each and every lead you send our way will be given the golden treatment. 

This does two things:\
**1)** Those leads that your sales reps were desperate to disqualify ASAP convert into customers!\
**2)** The customers that are not going to be buyers have a great customer experience, and can become brand advocates when they come across another person in need of a solution that you provide.
