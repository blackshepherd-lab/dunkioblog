  The 3 steps to getting us started on selling your product are:

  1. Share your customer facing email inbox with us

  2. Share your tech support / help desk ticketing system  (e.g Zendesk, Freshdesk, etc)

  3. Give us access to live chat transcripts and systems (e.g Intercom, Drift, Crisp)

When we start with a new client on our Instant Demo service, we need to ensure we have 95%+ of the information required to answer almost any question you will ever get about the product.

The 3 steps to getting us started on selling your product are:

1. **Share your customer facing email inbox with us** (Username and password, or IMAP credentials, shared inbox tools, or other)
2. **Share your tech support / help desk ticketing system**  (e.g Zendesk, Freshdesk, etc)
3. **Give us access to live chat transcripts and systems** (e.g Intercom, Drift, Crisp)

Giving us these permissions and access would take a total of 5 minutes. We can do the rest from there.

We use this trove of information to collate all the information and process it into a prioritised "Universe of Questions". We can do this without any further input from you.

This "**Universe of Questions**" is categorised into buckets, and using the data on the requests you have received to date we are able to rank them by frequency and importance.

Answers to these questions are then populated based on our understanding of the product and access to your documentation and systems.

At this stage we actually do our own refinement of your wording, the way you share the benefits and features of your product, and the way that the product is sold. 

Quite often we can improve information and clarity significantly by being thoughtful and strategic about how we answer these questions. 

We now have a draft **"Answer Book v1.0"** that we start working with. Quite often this Answer Book would be the first very thoughtful categorisation of user questions and answers that a company has ever produced. We typically have a list of "**Questions to Address**" that require further input from the client.

### Final Approval

We then do a series of interview with our clients where we play back our key findings and share our Answer Book. We seek client approval on the Answers. We aim to be fully transparent on not only the content that we will use to fulfill sales inquiries, but also our approach, philosophy and any areas we need more information on. Trust between our clients and our company is paramount for us.

The remaining questions we have about your product are also addressed. These questions would not have been fully addressed in any of your previous inquiries from your help desk, email or live chat channels and would allow us to cover any cases we have thought of that you have not yet seen, and have the answers endorsed.

How long does this all take? From start to finish we can do it in 48 hours to 1 week, depending on the product complexity.

### We don't stop there - continuous refinement

The Answer Book is constantly being revised and updated as we field more and more questions for our clients, the market changes, and the product has more features released.

Our sales conversations are valuable sources of information on customer needs and how to position and market the product, and more importantly how to guide product development to suit customer needs.

We analyse our conversations, synthesize them and feed our analysis on the Answer Book back to our client teams for use in strategy, marketing and product decisions.

The queries are also routed to the support team so that FAQ, knowledge-base articles and web pages can be populated to reduce first line support volume.
